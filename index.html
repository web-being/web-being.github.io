<h2>If you want a website, please contact us:</h2>

{% include form.html %}

<hr/>

<h2>Sites we’ve already made:</h2>

{% assign posts=site.posts %}
{% include posts.html posts=posts %}

<hr/>

<h2>Why do we do that?</h2>

<p>Because we understand that you may need a website but have no resources, like time, money or knowledge. So we are here to help: we make sure that your web-site works for you and that is the best reward for us :)!</p>
